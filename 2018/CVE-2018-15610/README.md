## Summary
one-X Portal for IP Office is an application that runs on a web server connected to the IP Office telephone system. Using a web browser, one can access 
the one-X Portal for IP Office and use it to perform actions such as:

* Control your telephone calls
* View details of calls and directories of contacts
* Configure settings that affect how your calls are treated by the telephone system
* Conference calls
* Manage your voicemail messages

## Details
Avaya one-x for ip office contains a default low privileged account, which has limited access to the application, where it's intended to perform backup duties.

An arbitrary file download issue was found in the backup portal, affecting to either Linux and Windows versions of the 9.x, 10.0.x and 10.1.x series. An 
authenticated remote attacker could send specially crafted request leading into potential information disclosure and DoS. 

DownloadToLocalDriveServlet allows to download any operating system file.

```

```

This request also deletes de file after being downloaded (depending on the OS file and process permissions). Be carefull on Windows version as process runs with 
system privileges.

Vulnerable piece of code:

```php
    if (sessionManager.isSessionAlive(session)) {
      String folder = req.getParameter("folder");
      String filename = req.getParameter("filename");
      if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) logger.debug(new Object[] { "doGet(), folder:", Helper.reformatFolderPath(folder), ", filename: ", filename });
      BufferedOutputStream bos = null;
      FileInputStream in = null;
      try {
        resp.setContentType("application/zip");
        resp.setHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=" + filename + ";");
        bos = new BufferedOutputStream(resp.getOutputStream());
        in = new FileInputStream(Helper.reformatFolderPath(folder) + filename)

```


## Impact
This vulnerability can be use to download arbitrary files and even to cause a DoS due to file removal.

## Recommendation
DownloadToLocalDriveServlet it is only intended to download backup zip files from server to the desktop. Backup file default folder it's predefined setting that 
appears as serverFolderForBackup directive on $TOMCAT\bin\inyama-user.xml file, and therefore do not need to be passed through GET parameter. 

```php
String serverFolder = loggedInUser.getServerFolder() + File.separator;
File downloadedFile = new File(Helper.reformatFolderPath(serverFolder), fileName);
```

- Implement file type checks and enforce/append .zip extension (this is also recomended for UploadFromLocalServlet.class which allows arbitrary file upload, 
but at least enforces destination folder)

- Avoid sending filename as GET or ensure path traversal protection is in place

https://downloads.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/101051984

* For 10.0.x, upgrade to IP Office one-X portal 10.0.702.16
* For 10.1.x, upgrade to IP Office one-X portal 10.1.300.12
* Fix is also provided in 11.0 or later

Avaya strongly recommends following networking and security best practices by implementing firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya products and the surrounding network from this potential 
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied. Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the customer's security policies may be required during this interim period, but the 
System Product operating system or application should not be modified unless the change is approved by Avaya. Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

## Timeline
* 18/03/2018 - Vuln discovered during pentest engagement
* 19/03/2018 - Avaya product security contacted
* 19/03/2018 - Avaya product security replied
* 23/03/2018 - Avaya product security confirmed and planned fix
* 23/07/2018 - Fix available to customers
* 31/08/2018 - Public disclosure

(Kudos to the ProducSec Team, for the excelent communication and incident handling)
